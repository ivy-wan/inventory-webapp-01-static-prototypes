Welcome to my basic web-app building tutorial series. Together, we will build a simple "inventory" web application. The running example will be a homework tracker; in each tutorial, you will be given the next steps.

However, you can (and should!) also build your own application that is more applicable to your own interests and needs, both to keep things more interesting for you and to help you practice applying the skills and understandings you gain. 

# Part 01: Prototyping our web pages 

Our first steps is to build **static prototypes** of our intended web app. 

> You can view these example prototype pages on [the Github Pages site.](https://ivy-wan.github.io/inventory-webapp-01-static-prototypes/)

## (1.1) Why are we using a front-end framework like Materialize?

To help avoid spending too much time on making our web pages look good, we will utilize [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), a front-end "framework", to do a lot of the design work and decisions for us. It is an open-source library of CSS and JS that can be easily used in any web page. By incorporating Materialize's preset classes (and a little bit of JS to initialize the more "interactive" elements), your HTML elements will be styled to have that bold, user-friendly, "material" design that was popularized by Google product designers. Materialize can also help make pages more "responsive", or adaptive to the user's device, be it a laptop or tablet or mobile phone.

## (1.2) Building the static prototype pages

There are three HTML pages. Each was first generated with the Emmet abbreviation in VSCode (simply create an empty HTML file, type `!` and hit enter) before filling in the head and body with content. The style/layout of the content was largely done with Materialize, with a little bit of custom CSS.

### (1.2.1) Materialize features used

For all 3 pages, the relevant parts of the Materialize library are "imported" at various points. 

Materialize's CSS and Google's material icons are linked in the `<head>`:

```html
    <!-- Materialize CSS and Icons-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
```

At the bottom of the `<body>` is a link to Materialize's JS, and a short "auto-initialize" script:

```html
    <!-- Materialize JavaScript -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Auto-initialize Materialize elements (Note - more specific initialization may be required for certain elements)-->
    <script> M.AutoInit();</script>
```

The main content of the pages are found in the `<body>`, above the scripts. Each page uses a number of Materialize features in its content. Relevant documentation from the [Materialize website](https://materializecss.com/) is linked for each feature.

- All pages:
    - Surrounding container `<div>` to lightly center all main content. | [container documentation](https://materializecss.com/grid.html#grid-container)
    - Headings | [headers documentation](https://materializecss.com/typography.html#headers)
    - Stylized `<button>` elements or anchor `<a>` elements that are styled like buttons | [button documentation](https://materializecss.com/buttons.html)
    - "Waves" effects applied to various elements, largely buttons. | [waves effect documentation](https://materializecss.com/waves.html)
    - Icons (`<i>`) - (Materialize supports Google's Material Icons) | [icons documentation](https://materializecss.com/icons.html)
    - A Navbar, which collapses and shows a sidenav for small screens (`<header>` and `<nav>`) | [navbar documentation](https://materializecss.com/navbar.html)

- `index.html`, the "home" page
    - Simple greeting in a heading | [headers documentation](https://materializecss.com/typography.html#headers)
    - Link-"button" to the Stuff page | ([button documentation](https://materializecss.com/buttons.html))

- `assignments.html`, the page with a list of all assignments 
    - Table of info for each item (name & quantity). | [table documentation](https://materializecss.com/table.html)
    - "INFO / EDIT" link-"button" to Item detail page and "DELETE" link-"button" (non-functional) for each item | [button documentation](https://materializecss.com/buttons.html)
    - "Add Item" form that contains:
        - Text, number, and date inputs  | [form inputs documentation](https://materializecss.com/text-inputs.html )
            - Note that we are using the standard `type=date` rather than the custom Materialize "Date Pickers"
        - A Select input | [select inputs documentation](https://materializecss.com/select.html )
        - A form submit button | [button documentation](https://materializecss.com/buttons.html#submit)
        - The form layout is done via Materialize's Grid system. | [grid documentation](https://materializecss.com/grid.html#grid-intro)

- `detail.html`, the page with a detailed view of a single assignment
    - Similar to `stuff.html`, bunch of info in a table  | [table documentation](https://materializecss.com/table.html)
    - Text size/layout is responsive to screen size/layout. | [flow text documentation](https://materializecss.com/typography.html#flow)
    - "DELETE" link-"button" (non-functional) | [button documentation](https://materializecss.com/buttons.html)
    - Modal ("pop-up" mini-window) | [modal documentation](https://materializecss.com/modals.html)
        - "EDIT" link-"button" outside the modal that triggers showing the modal.
        - "NEVER MIND" button inside the modal that closes the modal. 
    - "Edit Item" form inside the modal - similar to the "Add Item" form in `stuff.html` with an additional `<textarea>` for description | [textarea input documentation](https://materializecss.com/text-inputs.html#textarea )

> A great way to see what Materialize is doing for the page is to temporarily remove or comment out the links to the Materialize CSS/JS.

> Our nav bar is particularly repetitious, as it takes a large chunk of code and appears the same on all pages. We will eventually introduce a useful technique in EJS called "partials" that will allow us to encapsulate and reuse HTML chunks.

### (1.2.2) Custom CSS features

In both the `assignments.html` and `detail.html` pages, there is a small internal CSS stylesheet to set a few custom styles. The CSS is identical for both pages.

```css
    /* these make the forms pop a little with a border that highlights when interacting with form inputs */
    form {
        border: solid 2px lightgrey;
        padding: 10px;
        border-radius: 5px;
    }

    form:focus-within {
        border-color: orange;
    }
    /* this makes the table rows change color when your mouse hovers over them */
    tr:hover {
        background-color: #F0F0F0;
    }

```
> This example isn't using external stylesheets or JS scripts yet, which is again causing some repetitiousness. We'll refactor a little bit later, but for now its okay keeping everything related to one page in one file. However, if you wish to organize your own CSS and JS into external files from the start, go right ahead!

## (1.3) Viewing and Testing the prototype pages locally.

These example prototype pages are published online via [the Github Pages site.](https://atcs-wang.github.io/inventory-webapp-01-static-prototypes/)

However, as you write HTML files on your computer, you'll want to see how they'd look in the browser without having to publish them first. 

Here are 2 ways you can view your pages locally:
1) Enter the *full file path* of your HTML file into the URL bar of your browser. 
    - An easy way to get that path is to right-click the file in VSCode's Explorer and choose **"Copy Path"**; then paste it into your browser's URL bar. 
    - Note that any changes to your file do not automatically update the page in the browser; refresh to see any updates. 
3) Install the VSCode Extension **"Live Server"**  (by Ritwick Dey). Then, right-click on your file and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.
    - This starts a simple web server on your computer, serving files ONLY in the VSCode project folder. (Right-click on any HTML file and choose "Stop Live Server" to stop the server).
    - This web server is only accessible locally to your own web browser: notice the URL contains the special "localhost" IP address (`127.0.0.1`), which refers to your own computer. The port number after the colon (likely `5500`) refers to the specific server process.
    - The best part of Live Server is that any *changes to your HTML file will result in an automatic refresh to your browser page!*

## (1.4) Optional: Publishing your prototypes with Github Pages

Althoug prototypes aren't a fully working webapp yet, you can still publish your own prototypes on the web if you wish!

You can use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to easily publish any Github repository as a simple website.  The process is fairly simple:
1) Create a public Github repository with your HTML pages.
2) Go to that repo's webpage, and go to the **Settings** tab. 
3) In the **Pages** section (left nav menu), under **Source** choose your main (or master) branch. 
4) The publishing process will take a few minutes. Once published, you can click the provided URL ( of the form `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPONAME>/`) to see your homepage (`index.html`)
6) Any pushed commits to that main branch will update the published website (after a few minutes delay).

Github Pages creates a *static file server* for your webpage, which handles simple HTTP requests for your files. 

> Technically, you only get one static web server per account. If you have multiple website repositories, they are all on one website domain, `<USERNAME>.github.io` but organized by repository name in the URL path, as if in separate "folders".

> Note, as you navigate your website, that the path of the URL corresponds contains the repository and name of the HTML files. The exception is the `index.html` - Pages interprets a URL without a file as as request for an `index.html` in that repository. That's why the provided URL, of the form `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPONAME>/`, will display your `index.html` as the homepage. 

## (1.5) Conclusion:

In the next lesson, we'll discuss what a web server does and build our own.
